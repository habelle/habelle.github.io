## ✅ Key Features and Benefits

### ✅ Fully Adjustable Loft
You can add or remove the memory foam fill to achieve your ideal firmness and loft. Whether you're a side, back, or stomach sleeper, this pillow adjusts to support your unique posture and alignment.

### ✅ Premium Materials
Made with a proprietary blend of shredded memory foam and microfiber called Oomph™, the pillow offers plush comfort without compromising support. The Lulltra™ cover is soft, breathable, and derived from bamboo.

### ✅ Certified Safe
The Coop pillow is CertiPUR-US and GREENGUARD Gold certified, ensuring it's free from harmful chemicals and safe for sensitive skin.

## 🔄 My Experience
I spent the first few nights adjusting the fill—adding a bit more each night until it felt just right. After that:
- No more neck stiffness in the morning
- My shoulders feel supported but not elevated
- I genuinely wake up feeling more refreshed

The pillow held its shape well and didn’t flatten out like cheaper alternatives.
